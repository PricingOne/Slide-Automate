# Slide Automation Tool Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the Slide Automation Tool, which utilizes Python to automate the creation of PowerPoint presentations based on cleaned data. The tool is structured into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the slide generation process.

## Table of Contents
- [Landscape Section](#landscape-section)
- [Pricing Section](#pricing-section)
- [Project Steps](#project-steps)

# Landscape Section

## Introduction
In the slide automation landscape, we utilize 10 basic slides to create 22 sections. Here’s a breakdown of the sections:

- Market Trends by Manufacturer
- Market Trends by Brands
- Market Trends by Sectors
- Market Trends by Segments
- Market Concentration By Manufacturer
- Market Concentration By Brands
- Market Concentration By Sectors
- Market Concentration By Segments
- Market Growth By Sectors
- Market Growth By Segments
- Market Growth By Retailer For Region
- Value Vs Avg Price By Sectors
- Value Vs Avg Price By Segments
- Value Vs Avg Price By Retailer For Region
- Share and Growth By Manufacturer/Brands
- Share And Growth By Manufacturer By Sector
- Share And Growth By Brands By Sector
- Share And Growth By Manufacturer By Segment
- Share And Growth By Brands By Segment
- Category Trends
- Share Evolution By Brand

# [Step 1: Import Libraries](https://github.com/khaledSeifEleslam/Slide-Automate/blob/main/general_functions/generalFunctions.ipynb)

```python
# Import necessary libraries for PowerPoint automation and data manipulation
from pptx import Presentation
import win32com.client as win32
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
import re
import sys
import time
import shutil
import os
import warnings

# Set default warnings to be ignored
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```

# [Step 2: Clean DataFrames](https://github.com/khaledSeifEleslam/Slide-Automate/blob/main/Landscape%20slide%20duplicate/Landscape%20duplicate.ipynb)

```python
def clean_dataframes(df_dict):
    """
    Cleans a dictionary of DataFrames by filtering out unwanted rows and handling NaN values.
    
    Parameters:
        df_dict (dict): A dictionary containing DataFrames to clean.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing cleaned DataFrames.
    """
    for key in df_dict.keys():
        df = df_dict[key].copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original
        df = df[df['Top Brands'] != 'Others']  # Filter out 'Others' rows
        df = df.fillna(0)  # Replace NaN values with 0
        df_dict[key] = df  # Update the dictionary with the cleaned DataFrame
    return df_dict

# [Step 5: Save Presentation](https://github.com/khaledSeifEleslam/Slide-Automate/blob/main/Landscape%20slide%20duplicate/Landscape%20duplicate.ipynb)

```python
